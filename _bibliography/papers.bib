  abstract={This paper examines trends in wage, income, and consumption inequality in Turkey from 2002 to 2023, a period marked by unorthodox economic policymaking before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Using microdata from the Turkish Statistical Institute’s Household Budget Survey and the Survey of Income and Living Conditions, we document several salient distributional patterns. Wage inequality declined steadily over two decades, including during the recent episode of policy experimentation—coinciding with sustained minimum wage hikes and a rising share of university-educated workers. Income inequality also fell, though less markedly, before reversing in recent years due to widening disparities in capital and entrepreneurial income. In addition, consumption inequality rose dramatically during the unorthodox policy period, exceeding income inequality growth and driven primarily by a surge in durable goods consumption among top-decile households. These findings reveal the complex and multi-dimensional distributional consequences of unconventional economic policy in emerging markets and highlight the importance of examining inequality across multiple dimensions when evaluating policy effectiveness.},

abstract = {This paper examines the evolution of commodity market integration from the late 16th century to the early 20th century. For this purpose, we compile a new and comprehensive data set on wheat prices, covering 76 cities and 16 countries across Europe, North America, East & South Asia, and the Middle East. To build separate international and country-specific market integration indices over time, we estimate a dynamic factor model that decomposes the price movements of each city into international, country-specific, and city-specific components. The model imposes an orthogonality condition to distinguish international integration from country-specific integration and hence avoids double counting. In terms of the timing of market integration, the results suggest that it started early, with gradual but meandering gains from the 16th century on, which accelerated after the 1820s. As for the composition of the gains in integration, the findings indicate that they were predominantly international rather than country-specific. In terms of the geography of market integration, the results show that northwest Europe was at the epicenter, with North America catching up in the late 19th century but the Middle East, Iberia, and East & South Asia lagging behind.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
