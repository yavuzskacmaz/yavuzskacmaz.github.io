Welcome to my website! I am a second-year PhD student in economics at UC Davis. My research focuses on international economics and macroeconomics, mainly through a historical perspective. Before starting my PhD, I completed my BA in Economics and History and MA in Economics at Bogazici University in Istanbul.
